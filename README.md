## What is Noshiro?

Noshiro is a C language basic library that provides basic structures and algorithms in C language development, including common data structures (linked lists, hash tables, arrays, log) and basic algorithms (md5, sha).

Compared with Glib, it is more lightweight and easier to integrate into project engineering, providing assistance for C language library development.
